# IrrigSense
This project designed an Irrigation Scheduling Tool using KSU TAPS data in Western Kansas to help farmers manage irrigation water effectively. Our tool was designed with corn but is very flexible to be used and applied to other crops. The flowchart below explains our irrigation scheduling algorithm.

Our algorithm was computed and validated with Team 16 volumetric water content and ET data. with validation results as seen below:
